    "## Introduction to the NLP Analysis of Hotel Reviews Project\n",
    "In today's rapidly evolving hospitality industry, understanding customer sentiment and feedback has become more critical than ever. As hotels strive to deliver exceptional guest experiences, tapping into the wealth of information contained within customer reviews is invaluable. The NLP Analysis of Hotel Reviews project aims to harness the power of Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to extract insights, trends, and actionable intelligence from a vast corpus of hotel reviews.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Project Goals\n",
    "\n",
    "The primary objectives of this project are to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Uncover Valuable Insights:** By analyzing customer reviews, we seek to uncover hidden patterns, sentiments, and feedback that can provide deep insights into guests' experiences and expectations.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Enhance Business Strategies:** The insights gained from this analysis will drive strategic decision-making across various departments within the hospitality industry. From operations and service improvement to marketing and customer relations, these insights will offer a holistic view of customer perceptions.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Improve Guest Experiences:** Armed with a better understanding of what delights and disappoints guests, hotels can tailor their services, amenities, and overall experience to meet customer expectations and preferences.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Provide Actionable Intelligence:** The project aims to deliver not just raw data, but actionable intelligence. This includes recommendations, trends, and predictions that can drive effective, data-driven strategies.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Value Proposition\n",
    "\n",
    "By combining the power of data analytics, NLP, and machine learning, this project aspires to offer the hospitality industry a comprehensive toolkit for understanding, analyzing, and responding to customer feedback. The insights provided have the potential to significantly impact business strategies, leading to improved guest satisfaction, stronger brand loyalty, and ultimately, greater success in an increasingly competitive landscape."

    "One potential problem with this distribution is class imbalance. Class imbalance occurs when the distribution of classes in the target variable is heavily skewed towards one class compared to the others. In this case, the majority of the scores are concentrated at the higher end of the scale (scores of 10.0, 9.6, 9.2), while the lower scores have much fewer instances.\n",
    "\n",
    "Imbalanced classes can pose challenges for classification models because they may lead to biased predictions and reduced accuracy. Models trained on imbalanced data tend to be biased towards the majority class, resulting in poor performance for predicting minority classes. In this scenario, it means the model might be better at predicting positive scores (higher values) but could struggle with accurately predicting negative scores (lower values) due to the scarcity of instances in those classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "To address this issue, we can perform **resampling**, which involves either oversampling the minority class (increasing the number of instances) or undersampling the majority class (decreasing the number of instances) to achieve a balanced class distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, we will soon see that given the data bucketing that we perfrom later, this problem will be automatically addressed."
